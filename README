Prerequisites
-------------

This code uses maven for compilation and dependency management.


How to Run the Code
-------------

Train and Test
./runhandles.sh <train> <test> <.vec> <.counts> null


Research Code, Not Meant for Immediate Use
-------------

This code also builds context vectors for each twitter handle, resulting in large vectors for all
seen usernames. This is a very large GB-sized data file, and not part of the repository.
I am releasing this code for others to make use of the feature functions, but it will not run
out-of-box due to the reliance on these large data files that were separately computed.
